        <h1>CSHS Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the top projects our club has helped lead. This will help give you an idea of what you can particpate in once joining,</p>
        <h3>Code Snippets</h3>
        <p>Members helped make small snippets of code. They also made questions to go with the snippets. The questions ranged form what would be returned to syntax.
            The code and questions were then hung up around the school. People were able to answer the questions and win a prize if they got them all right.
        </p>
        <h3>Scratch Projects</h3>
        <p>Members were able to build projects on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch.</a> They also maid flyers for their projects.
        We are working on coordinating a trip to several elementary schools to spark interest in coding with our projects. Some members also posted tutorials on YouTube.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As we work on more projects, this page will be updated to include them.</p>
